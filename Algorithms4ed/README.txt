This project includes solutions for exercises in chapters 1-4 of Algorithms 4ed by Sedgewick 
and Wayne excluding sections on Experiments. The solutions are developed or sometimes just 
presented with Java 8.

Most data structures of significance are in the ds, graph, pq and sort packages with some that
are more algorithms than structures in the analysis package.

The annotations, exceptions, ejs and io packages are part of EverydayJavaSerialization that is 
used only for exercise 1.1.19. 

The v package contains array utilities and classes supporting them. Some of them are used 
frequently in exercise solutions. v.ArrayUtils contains hundreds of static methods for Java 
primitive and generic arrays. 

The utils package contains several classes with additional static methods used in exercise solutions. 

External library dependencies are included in the distribution in the ExternalDependencies folder
and can be downloaded from the following locations:
