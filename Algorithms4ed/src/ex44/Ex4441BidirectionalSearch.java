  4.4.41 Bidirectional search. Develop a class for the source-sink shortest
  -paths problem that is based on code like Algorithm 4.9 but that initial-
  izes the priority queue with both the source and the sink. Doing so leads 
  to the growth of an SPT from each vertex; your main task is to decide pre-
  cisely what to do when the two SPTs collide.
  
  (Algorithm 4.9 is Dijkstraâ€™s shortest-paths algorithm on p655)
  
  This is implemented in graph.DijkstraSourceSinkBidirectionalSP for graphs with
  nonnegative edge weights and demonstrated below. Note that some paths found
  bidirectionally are different than those found unidirectionally, as can be ex-
  pected, but their endpoints are identical and the path weight differences are 
  less than 2.3*10^-16 for all shortest paths in tinyEWD, mediumEWD and 1000EWD.
  These differences may be accountable as rounding discrepancies and in some cases
  the bidirectional algorithm found technically shorter paths.
  
  DijkstraSourceSinkBidirectionalSP includes only necessary methods to simplify
  reading of it. A complete version with all supporting methods in 
  graph.DijkstraSourceSinkSP is graph.DijkstraSourceSinkBidirectionalSPComplete.
  
  DijkstraSourceSinkBidirectionalSP uses the same basic format as DijkstraSourceSinkSP
  except its constructor takes both the input graph and its reverse as arguments to 
  separate the overhead of graph reversal from that of finding shortest paths. The 
  stopping condition is implemented in relax1() and relax2() as described on page 3 of
  "Efficient Point-to-Point Shortest Path Algorithms" that's  available for download 
  from http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos423/Handouts/EPP%20shortest%20path%20algorithms.pdf.
  When the stopping condition is true, the boolean variable done is set to true causing
  queue processing to stop. Then the shortest path can be constructed by joining the 
  forward and reverse shortest path segments on the common vertex with the minimum forward 
  + reverse weight as mentioned on page 2 of https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.006/fall11/lectures/lecture18.pdf. 
  path() does this using min() to find the min-weighted common vertex.
