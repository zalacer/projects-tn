  4.4.12  Adapt the  DirectedCycle and Topological classes from Section 
  4.2 to use the  EdgeweightedDigraph and  DirectedEdge APIs of this sec-
  tion, thus implementing EdgeWeightedCycleFinder and  EdgeWeightedTopo-
  logical classes.
  
  Some time ago I adapted DirectedCycleX, TopologicalX and DepthFirstOrderX 
  for compatibility with EdgeweightedDigraph and DirectedEdge and also with
  EuclidianDigraph and EuclidianEdgeWeightedDigraph. Adding more classes is
  not necessary for this functionality and given the the number of graph
  classes already in place, more isn't desired.
