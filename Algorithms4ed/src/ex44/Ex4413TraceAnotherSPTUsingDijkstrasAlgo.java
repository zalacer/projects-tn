  4.4.13  Show, in the style of the trace in the text, the process of 
  computing the SPT with Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for the digraph obtained 
  by removing the edge  5->7 from tinyEWD.txt (see page 644).
  
  I have already done two SPT traces and it's almost fully automated
  except for coordinate assignments but that's also been done twice for
  tinyEWD.txt and that's enough practice.  If you want to do it, the 
  method shown in solutions for ex4.4.6 and ex4.4.10 works ok.
