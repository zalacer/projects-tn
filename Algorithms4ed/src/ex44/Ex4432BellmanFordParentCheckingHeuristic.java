  4.4.32 Parent-checking heuristic. Modify Bellman-Ford to visit a vertex v 
  only if its SPT parent edgeTo[v] is not currently on the queue. This heur-
  istic has been reported by Cherkassky, Goldberg, and Radzik to be useful in 
  practice. Prove that it correctly computes shortest paths and that the worst-
  case running time is proportional to EV.
  
  In Bellman-FordSP edgeTo[] is a DirectedEdgeX[] while the queue is a Queue<Integer>
  so an element of edgeTo[] can't be in the queue. What Cherkassky, Goldberg, and 
  Radzik's "parent-checking heuristic" does is to relax or "scan" a vertex only if
  it's parent vertex isn't in the queue. Use of the word "parent" refers to rooted
  trees and in such "the parent of a vertex is the vertex connected to it on the path 
  to (from) the root" (i.e. it's one step closer to the root or source than the vertex).

  Therefore when using the BellmanFordSP reprepresentation, this heuristic applies only 
  if edgeTo[v] is non-null, since only then are v and its parent, edgeTo[v].from(), in 
  the SPT, and edgeTo[v].from() is in the queue when relax(G,v) is called.
  
  Since if a parent is relaxed and its weight is decreased all its children need to
  be subsequently relaxed. Therefore there's no point to relaxing a child if its parent
  is queued up for relaxation and avoiding that can avoid reprocessing of vertices at
  the expense of determining if a vertex is in the queue. Therefore the parent-checking 
  heuristic correctly determines the SPT because it essentially does the Bellman-Ford 
  algo and has the same E*V upper bound but may require fewer relaxations and take less
  time.
  
  The Bellman-Ford algo with Cherkassky, Goldberg, and Radzik's parent-checking heuristic
  is implemented in graph.BellmanFordSPCGR and demonstrated below.

    algorithms: Theory and experimental evaluation. Mathematical Programming,
