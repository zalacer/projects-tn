  4.4.46 Animate. Write a client program that does dynamic graphical 
  animations of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
  
  This is done by introducing a simplified  constructor and a static 
  method named animateDijkstraEx4446 in DijkstraSPXtrace that are 
  demonstrated below by drawing a map of Oldenburg using data from
  https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/SpatialDataset.htm (#5). The map is 
  populated by drawing only newly introduced forward edges of shortest 
  paths from all vertices in interleaved increasing and decreasing order.
