  4.4.45 Fast Bellman-Ford. Develop an algorithm that breaks the linearithmic 
  running time barrier for the single-source shortest-paths problem in general 
  edge-weighted digraphs for the special case where the weights are integers 
  known to be bounded in absolute value by a constant.
  
  I know of no such algorithm without additional constraints particularly a re-
  quirement of no negative cyles. "Fast Bellman-Ford" seems to refer to what's
  usually called the "Shortest Path Faster Algorithm", but that's already im-
  plemented in graph.BellManFordSP and has the same VE worst case performance as 
  the basic Bellman-Ford algorithm. 
  
  If a graph doesn't have a negative cycle and its weights are integers bounded 
  in absolute value by a constant, then it can be reweighted to have all positive 
  weights that are bounded by a possibly different constant C and processed with 
  Dijkstra's algorithm using a bucket queue to compute the single-source shortest 
  paths with runtime ~ E + VC or faster with radix heaps according to Mehlhorn 
  and Sanders* (sections 10.4.1-2).  
  
  An implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm using a bucket queue based on Mehlhorn 
  and Sanders* and an improved algorithm by Robert B. Dial as described by Subhash 
  Suri in https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~suri/cs231/ShortestPaths.pdf on pages 40-41
  (available locally at ImprovedDialDijkstraSP-Suri-2004.pdf) is demonstrated below. 
  It requires larger graphs with relatively small max edge weights to show a per-
  formance advantage over Dijkstra's algorithm immplemented with an IndexMinPQ.
