  4.4.28 Longest paths in DAGs. Develop an implementation  AcyclicLP that can solve
  the longest-paths problem in edge-weighted DAGs, as described in Proposition T.
  
  This has already been done in 
    http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/AcyclicLP.java
  that's locally available at graph.AcyclicLP.
