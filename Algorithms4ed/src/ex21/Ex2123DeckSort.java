  2.1.23 Deck sort. Ask a few friends to sort a deck of cards (see Exercise 2.1.13). 
  Observe them carefully and write down the method(s) that they use.
  
  Jim does what he calls a bucket sort first during which he flips through all the
  cards and puts them in separate piles according to their suit. Then he picks up a 
  pile and sorts it by hand using "no particular method" (his own words) and does 
  that for all the piles. Then he stacks the sorted piles on top of each other in 
  order by suit.
  
  That's pretty much what I do and already desribed, except if there's space then
  areas can be designated for all the cards in each suit and the cards can be placed
  directed in their slot in their area. The reason for sorting by suits is that for a 
  deck to be sorted it must be sorted first by suits and then by rank within each suit.
  
  Most people that I've encountered either don't think much about how they sort anything
  or they're programmers and tend to overthink the issue and make it more complicated 
  than necessary.
