  2.2.22 3-way mergesort. Suppose instead of dividing in half at each step, you divide
  into thirds, sort each third, and combine using a 3-way merge. What is the order of
  growth of the overall running time of this algorithm?
  
  ~NlgN since log₃N = log₂N/log₂3 where log₂3 is a constant, which doesn't affect the 
  orderof growth. Order of growth in relation to tilde expressions is discussed in the 
  text on pages 179 and 186.
