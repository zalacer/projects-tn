  4.2.20 Directed Eulerian cycle. An Eulerian cycle is a directed cycle that 
  contains each edge exactly once. Write a graph client Euler that finds an 
  Eulerian cycle or reports that no such tour exists. Hint: Prove that a
  digraph G has a directed Eulerian cycle if and only if G is connected and 
  each vertex has its indegree equal to its outdegree.
  
  This is already done in 
    http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42digraph/DirectedEulerianCycle.java
  that's available locally at graph.DirectedEulerianCycle.
