  4.2.3  Create a copy constructor for  Digraph that takes as input
  a digraph G and creates and initializes a new copy of the digraph.
  Any changes a client makes to G should not affect the newly created
  digraph.
  
  graph.DigraphX already has such a constructor since it's based on
    http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42digraph/Digraph.java
