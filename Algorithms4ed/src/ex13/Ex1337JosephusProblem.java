//  1.3.37 Josephus problem. In the Josephus problem from antiquity, N people are in dire
//  straits and agree to the following strategy to reduce the population. They arrange them-
//  selves in a circle (at positions numbered from 0 to Nâ€“1) and proceed around the circle,
//  eliminating every Mth person until only one person is left. Legend has it that Josephus
//  figured out where to sit to avoid being eliminated. Write a  Queue client  Josephus that
//  takes N and M from the command line and prints out the order in which people are
//  eliminated (and thus would show Josephus where to sit in the circle).
//  % java Josephus 7 2
//  1 3 5 0 4 2 6

// looks like an array application to me, though some would prefer an ArrayList and
// nobody would use a queue except to pass this exercise, which is bad training for
// encouraging choice of techically appropriate solutions.
