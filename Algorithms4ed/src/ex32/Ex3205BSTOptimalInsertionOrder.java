  3.2.5  Suppose that we have an estimate ahead of time of how often 
  search keys are to be accessed in a BST, and the freedom to insert 
  them in any order that we desire. Should the keys be inserted into 
  the tree in increasing order, decreasing order of likely frequency 
  of access, or some other order? Explain your answer.
  
  Clearly placing more frequently accessed keys near the top reduces
  overall search time. This can be optimized with dynamic programming
  as shown at 
  https://udel.edu/~caviness/Class/CISC320-02S/lectures/lecture26-Apr12.html
  that's based on material in chapter 42 of R. Sedgewick, Algorithms in C++.
