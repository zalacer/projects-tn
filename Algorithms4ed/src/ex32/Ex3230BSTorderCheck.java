  3.2.30 Order check. Write a recursive method isOrdered() that takes a  
  Node and two keys  min and  max as arguments and returns true if all 
  the keys in the tree are between min and max; min and max are indeed 
  the smallest and largest keys in the tree, respectively; and the BST 
  ordering property holds for all keys in the tree;  false otherwise.
  
  This is already implemented as BST.isBST(Node x, Key min, Key max);
