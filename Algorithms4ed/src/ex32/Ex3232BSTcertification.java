  3.2.32 Certification. Write a method isBST() that takes a Node as argument 
  and returns  true if the argument node is the root of a binary search tree,  
  false otherwise. Hint : This task is also more difficult than it might seem, 
  because the order in which you call the methods in the previous three exer-
  cises is important.
  
  Certification is already sufficently handled with BST.check().
