  3.2.4  Suppose that a certain BST has keys that are integers between  
  1 and 10, and we search for 5. Which sequence below cannot be the 
  sequence of keys examined?
    a. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5
    b. 4, 10, 8, 7, 53
    c. 1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 6, 5
    d. 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 5
    e. 1, 2, 10, 4, 8, 5
    
    b is impossible since 53 is presumed not to be in the bst.
