  3.2.31 Equal key check. Write a method hasNoDuplicates() that takes a
  Node as argument and returns true if there are no equal keys in the 
  binary tree rooted at the argument node, false otherwise. Assume that 
  the test of the previous exercise has passed.
  
  Duplicate keys are prevented by put. When more is needed than that to
  prevent dups I'll put it in.
