  3.2.29 Binary tree check. Write a recursive method  isBinaryTree() that takes a 
  Node as argument and returns  true if the subtree count field N is consistent 
  in the data structure rooted at that node, false otherwise. Note : This check 
  also ensures that the data structure has no cycles and is therefore a binary 
  tree (!).
  
  This is already implemented as BST.isSizeConsistent();
