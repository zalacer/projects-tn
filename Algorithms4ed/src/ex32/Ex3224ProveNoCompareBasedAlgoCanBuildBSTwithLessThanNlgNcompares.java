  3.2.24  Prove that no compare-based algorithm can build 
  a BST using fewer than lg(N!) ~ N*lg(N) compares.
  
  Since the nodes in a BST can be printed in sorted order in
  ~ N time using inorder traversal, any algorithm that builds 
  a BST can be used to solve the sorting problem and therefore 
  cannot use fewer than lg(N!) compares as shown in the proof 
  of proposition I on pp280-281.
