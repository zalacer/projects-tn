  3.1.4  Develop Time and Event ADTs that allow processing of data as 
  in the example illustrated on page 367.
  
  I guess this refers to the following from p367 that looks like times and cities that
  can be represented with an ST<LocalTime,String>, or package them in 
  Tuple2<LocalTime,String>s then split those to make an ST or of course it's possible
  to create a new type perhaps named Event that has a Tuple2<LocalTime,String> field
  or separate LocalTime and String fields.
  
  from p367:
    09:00:00 Chicago
    09:00:03 Phoenix
    09:00:13 Houston
    09:00:59 Chicago
    09:01:10 Houston
    09:03:13 Chicago
    09:10:11 Seattle
    09:10:25 Seattle
    09:14:25 Phoenix
    09:19:32 Chicago
    09:19:46 Chicago
    09:21:05 Chicago
    09:22:43 Seattle
    09:22:54 Seattle
    09:25:52 Chicago
    09:35:21 Chicago
    09:36:14 Seattle
    09:37:44 Phoenix
    
  I don't see anything worth developing for this exercise because it doesn't ask to
  process anything.
