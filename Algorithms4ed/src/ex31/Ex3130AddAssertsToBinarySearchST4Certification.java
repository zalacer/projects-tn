  3.1.30 Certification. Add assert statements to BinarySearchST to 
  check algorithm invariants and data structure integrity after every 
  insertion and deletion. For example, every index  i should always 
  be equal to  rank(select(i)) and the array should always be in order.
  
  The BinarySearchST classes in the st package already have plenty of
  asserts.
