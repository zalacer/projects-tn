  3.1.28 Ordered insertions. Modify BinarySearchST so that inserting a key 
  that is larger than all keys in the table takes constant time (so that 
  building a table by calling put() for keys that are in order takes linear 
  time).
  
  Except for array resizing regarding constant time.
  
  This is done in st.BinarySearchSTex3128. Changes were made to the arrays
  constructor and to put().
