  4.3.28 Space-efficient data structures. Develop an implementation of the lazy ver-
  sion of Primâ€™s algorithm that saves space by using lower-level data structures for
  EdgeWeightedGraph and for MinPQ instead of Bag and Edge. Estimate the amount of
  memory saved as a function of V and E, using the memory-cost model of Section 1.4
  (see Exercise 4.3.11).
  
  This isn't a challenge and is uninteresting since LazyPrim is so slow compared to 
  EagerPrim that saving space won't be the main issue as graph size increases.
