  4.3.22 Minimum spanning forest. Develop versions of Prim’s and Kruskal’s 
  algorithms that compute the minimum spanning forest of an edge-weighted 
  graph that is not necessarily connected. Use the connected-components API 
  of Section 4.1 and find MSTs in each component.
  
  For Prim's algorithm this is already done with 
    http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/43mst/PrimMST.java
  that's locally available at graph.PrimMST.
  
  For Kruskal's algorithm this is done with 
    http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/43mst/KruskalMST.java
  that's locally available at graph.KruskalMST and is essentially the same as
  the version given in the text.
