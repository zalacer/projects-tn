  4.3.31 MST weights. Develop implementations of weight() for LazyPrimMST,
  PrimMST, and KruskalMST, using a lazy strategy that iterates through the 
  MST edges when the client calls weight() .Then develop alternate imple-
  mentations that use an eager strategy that maintains a running total as 
  the MST is computed.
  
  This is implemented in graph.LazyPrimMST
                         graph.PrimMSTBX
                         graph.KruskalMSTB
