  4.3.30 Euclidean weighted graphs. Modify your solution to Exercise 4.1.37 
  to create an API EuclideanEdgeWeightedGraph for graphs whose vertices are 
  points in the plane, so that you can work with graphical representations.
  
  See graph.EuclidianEdgeWeightedGraph for the implementation.
  
  It would have been useful to position this exercise much earlier. Up to now
  I've created a parallel GraphX within EdgeWeightedGraphX to adddress needs of 
  exercise solutions (e.g.4.3.18) and found it works well and is efficient in
  terms of reusability of existing classes based on GraphX.
