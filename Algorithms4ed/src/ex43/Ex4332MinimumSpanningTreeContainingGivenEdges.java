  4.3.32 Specified set. Given a connected edge-weighted graph G and a specified
  set of edges S (having no cycles), describe a way to find a minimum-weight 
  spanning tree of G that contains all the edges in S.
  
  Compute the MST of G then for each edge in S not already in the MST add it to
  the MST and break the cycle formed by removing the edge not in S with the greatest 
  weight.
  
  Similar problems to this are treated in the exercise and solution set at
    https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~liberti/teaching/isic/isc612-07/ex-gph-sol.pdf
