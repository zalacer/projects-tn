  4.3.29 Dense graphs. Develop an implementation of Primâ€™s algorithm that 
  uses an eager approach (but not a priority queue) and computes the MST 
  using V^2 edge-weight comparisons.
  
  Hint from http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/43mst/ exercise 19:
  Suppose that you implement an eager version of Prim's algorithm but instead 
  of using a priority queue to find the next vertex to add to the tree, you 
  scan through all V entries in the distTo[] array to find the non-tree vertex 
  with the smallest value. What would be the order of growth of the worst-case 
  running time for the eager version of Prim's algorithm on graphs with V ver-
  tices and E edges? When would this method be appropriate, if ever? Defend your 
  answer. Solution. Prim's algorithm would run in time proportional to V^2, that
  is optimal for dense graphs.
  
  This method is implemented in graph.PrimMSTBXV2 and demonstrated below.
