  4.3.9 Implement the constructor for EdgeWeightedGraph that reads a graph  
  from the input stream, by suitably modifying the constructor from Graph 
  (see page 526).
  
  This is already in 
    http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/EdgeWeightedGraph.java
  that's what I've been using with addition of an extra constructor as
  graph.EdgeWeightedGraphX. The unadulterated EdgeWeightedGraph is available
  locally as graph.EdgeWeightedGraph.
