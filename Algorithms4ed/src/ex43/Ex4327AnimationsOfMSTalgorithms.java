  4.3.27 Animations. Write a client program that does dynamic graphical 
  animations of MST algorithms. Run your program for mediumEWG.txt to 
  produce images like the figures on page 621 and page 624.
  
  For this a map of vertices to 2D cartesian points or something similar
  is needed, but has not been provided and I'm not going to try working
  it out for mediumEWG.txt or attempt it with random points. I already 
  did this in detail for tinyEWG.txt and graphically illustrated MST algos 
  with it for exercise 4.3.18. That isn't animated only since it's more 
  useful to have separate standalone graphs of each step for examination 
  and comparison.
