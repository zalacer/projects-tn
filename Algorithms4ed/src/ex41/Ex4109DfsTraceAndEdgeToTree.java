  4.1.9  Show, in the style of the figure on page 533, a detailed trace 
  of the call dfs(0) for the graph built by Graphâ€™s input stream con-
  structor for the file tinyGex2.txt (see Exercise 4.1.2). Also, draw 
  the tree represented by edgeTo[].
  
  My version of the trace is given by running DepthFirstTrace.trace("tinyGex2.txt",0)
  that is demonstrated below.
  
  Based on its output, the tree represented by edgeTo[] and more directly by
  DepthFirstTrace.pathTo() is 0-2-5-10-3-6.
