  4.1.13 Add a distTo() method to the BreadthFirstPaths API and 
  implementation, which returns the number of edges on the shortest
  path from the source to a given vertex. A distTo() query should 
  run in constant time.
  
  A BreadthFirstPaths API isn't given in the text and distTo() is already in 
  http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/BreadthFirstPaths.java
  that I used as the basis for graph.BreadthFirstPathsX.
