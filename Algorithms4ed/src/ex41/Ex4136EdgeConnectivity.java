  4.1.36 Edge connectivity. A bridge in a graph is an edge that, if removed, 
  would separate a connected graph into two disjoint subgraphs. A graph that 
  has no bridges is said to be edge connected. Develop a DFS-based data type 
  for determining whether a given graph is edge connected.
  
  Such a "data type" is http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/41graph/Bridge.java.
  It's locally available as graph.Bridge. Also see graph.BridgeTrace.
