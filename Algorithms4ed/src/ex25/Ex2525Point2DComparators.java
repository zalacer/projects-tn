  2.5.25 Points in the plane. Write three  static comparators for the Point2D
  data type of page 77, one that compares points by their x coordinate, one  
  that compares them by their y coordinate, and one that compares them by their 
  distance from the origin. Write two non-static comparators for the Point2D 
  data type, one that compares them by their distance to a specified point and 
  one that compares them by their polar angle with respect to a specified point.
  
  Point2D is part of the standard edu.princeton.cs.algs4 distribution and is
  also available at http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/25applications/Point2D.java
  and in this project at ds.Point2D. It more than answers this exercise.
