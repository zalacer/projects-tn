**Algorithms4ed** contains solutions to exercises in chapters 1-4 of Algorithms 4ed by Sedgewick and Wayne.
Exercise sections titled "Experiments" are mostly excluded.

**Seq** is a Java array wrapper extending java.util.ArrayList with most scala.Array methods and additional methods for conversions between between arrays and Seqs of any dimensionality/nesting.

**QueueWithSevenStacks** is a stack based queue implementation with a constant worst case number of stack operations per queue operation.

**CoreJavaForTheImpatient** features solutions for the 209 exercises in Cay S. Horstmann's book Core JavaÂ® for the Impatient and is packaged as an Eclipse project.

**EverydayJavaSerialization** is Java Serialization system for a code based tutorial and is packaged as an Eclipse project.

**UniversalToString** is a Java class with a static universalToString method that works for all Java classes including
those with cyclic dependendies. Any Java class's toString method can be configured simply to return universalToString(this).
It's been tested with arrays, collections, enums, maps and custom classes.

**DijkstrasAlgorithm** is a Java implementation of Dijkstra's shortest paths algorithm using a metaphor of a network of 
cities connected by roads and consists of one outer Java class in one file.

**InvertImageAkka** is an Akka/Scala example of parallel image processing and is packaged as an sbt project.

**Java8StreamTest** consists of two Java8 main classes, one for performance testing of IntStream
    and the other to test performance of the imperative for loop. First build the project with
    Maven to generate an executable jar or import it into Eclipse or other compatible IDE and
    export an executable jar. Then run the jar for each class separately on a quiescent system
    with no other executing java processes. The java command line should have -Xmx1024 or greater
    to minimize latency due to garbage collection. The runtime of each class should be under a
    minute since they are not IO bound because all writes during the test phase are to 
    NullOutputStream and no reading is done. My tests with these classes demonstrated IntStream
    performance is statistically more than 5 times faster on average and has a significantly
    larger mean/stddev ratio on average compared to imperative for loop performance.

**FactorialTailCall** is a Scala sbt project illustrating how a non tail recursive function can
    be converted into one that is for compiler optimization to avoid a StackOverflowError exception.
    It also demonstrates the ease of using Scala BigInt and sbt project configuration with a .scala
    configuration file and the git assembly plugin. This project is configured for Scala 2.10.4 and 
    sbt 0.13.7.
    
**JAX-RSdemo1** is a demo RESTful web service project implemented using JAX-RS and Apache CXF. This is
    a Maven Java project exported from Eclipse. A review of RESTful web services and instructions for
    building a RESTful web services project in Eclipse are in JAX-RSdemo1/RESTful-Web-Services.pdf.
    
**JavaClassMethodOverrideDemo** is a Java project demonstrating class method hiding.

**ScalaFunctionsAsArgsDemo** is a Scala project demonstrating functions as arguments.

**SendBCCMail** is a Java project demonstrating how to send only BCC mail with javax.mail.

**ReduceSideJoinDistCache** is a demo of MapReduce reduce side join using distributed cache.

**ReduceSideJoinTest** is another implementation of MapReduce reduce side join using distributed cache, but  written with several customized data classes and using the String concatenation operator (+) instead of StringBuilder in the reducer as was used in ReduceSideJoinDistCache. It was written for performance comparison with the latter. The conclusion is that ReduceSideJoinDistCache significantly outperforms ReduceSideJoinTest, because StringBuilder is faster with less overhead than String concatenation with "+" and customized Writable/WritableComparable data types with fields having unwrapped types such as int and String are more efficient for small datasets compared to wrapped types like IntWritable and Text. Even for large datasets, use of Text objects still incurs String creation overhead when they are reused and their values change, because that requires creating new Strings. However, reuse of numeric Writable and WritableComparable objects reduces object creation since they wrap primitive Java numeric types.
