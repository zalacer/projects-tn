"is connected to" is an equivalance relation which is a binary relation ~ on a
set that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

For a set X of sites (represented by ints) partitioned by an "is connected to"
equivilance relation:
  a connection is a pair of sites that are in the same equivalence class in X
  a component is an equivilance class in X
