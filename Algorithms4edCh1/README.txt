This project includes solutions for exercises in chapter 1 of Algorithms 4ed
by Sedgewick and Wayne. There are five sections in this chapter and a set of
exercises for each with solutions for them in packages ex11-ex15. There are a
total of 179 exercises. All solutions were developed using Java 8 version 
"1.8.0_77". 

Most data structures of significance presented in the text or developed in 
exercises are in the ds package. 

Specific algorithms presented in the text, used for exercises or developed in the
context of them are in the analysis package. 

The annotations, exceptions, ejs and io packages are part of 
EverydayJavaSerialization which is used only for exercise 1.1.19. 

The v package contains array utilities and classes supporting them. Some of them
are used frequently in exercise solutions. v.ArrayUtils contains hundreds of static
methods for Java primitive and generic arrays. 

The utils package contains several classes with additional static methods used in
exercise solutions. 

Referenced Libraries includes only algs4.jar which is bundled with this project and 
is avaiable for download from http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/.
