// 7. For this exercise, youâ€™ll need to read through the source code of the
// java.util.Scanner class. If input fails when using a Scanner, the Scanner
// class catches the input exception and closes the resource from which it consumes
// input. What happens if closing the resource throws an exception? How does this
// implementation interact with the handling of suppressed exceptions in the try-with-
// resources statement?

// Scanner.java source for Java version 8u40-b25 from 
// http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/8u40-b25/java/util/Scanner.java/
// is in Scanner.java in this package.
// Reviewing it, scanner creates a buffer and reads source into it with try/catch 
// on each read (line 790) so in process IO errors are immediately caught and 
// retained in the lastException variable. The close() method starts at line 1076 
// and its code shows that an exception arising during its execution of 
// ((Closeable)source).close() is caught and saved in lastException which can be 
// retrieved by calling Scanner.ioException().
// Thus Scanner provides an independent means of handling and retrieving exceptions
// that occur during resource closing. Testing this shows it works well. Tests were
// performed using parseData() with an externally caused exception and with an 
// internally configured deliberate exception. These tests and the code for parseDate()
// are included below.
