// 3. Can you ever have a mutator method return something other than void? Can you
// ever have an accessor method return void? Give examples when possible.

// Mutator methods often return non-void and boolean in particular to confirm operation.
// For example, ArrayList.add() returns boolean to confirm an element was added or not.
// An accessor method is constructed to return something that's not void. At least it 
// may return null, but that's not void but an "object variable to refer to no object at 
// all" (p74).
