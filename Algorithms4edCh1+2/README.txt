This project includes solutions for exercises in chapters 1 and 2 of Algorithms 4ed
by Sedgewick and Wayne. There are five sections for both chapters and a set of
exercises for each with solutions for them in packages ex11-ex15 and ex21-ex25. There are a
total of 343 exercises. The solutions are developed or sometimes just presented with Java 8.

Most data structures of significance are int the ds pq and sort packages with some that
are more algorithms than structures in the analysis package.

The annotations, exceptions, ejs and io packages are part of 
EverydayJavaSerialization which is used only for exercise 1.1.19. 

The v package contains array utilities and classes supporting them. Some of them
are used frequently in exercise solutions. v.ArrayUtils contains hundreds of static
methods for Java primitive and generic arrays. 

The utils package contains several classes with additional static methods used in
exercise solutions. 

Referenced Libraries includes only algs4.jar which is bundled with this project and 
is available for download from http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/.
