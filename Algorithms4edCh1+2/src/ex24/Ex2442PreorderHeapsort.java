  2.4.42 Preorder heaps. Implement a version of heapsort based on the idea of 
  representing the heap-ordered tree in preorder rather than in level order. 
  Count the number of compares used by your program and the number of compares 
  used by the standard implementation, for randomly ordered keys with N = 10^3, 
  10^6 and 10^9.
  
  There are possible implementations that use more compares or the same number of
  compares but must have worse performance since they require extra calculations
  and technically aren't interesting for that reason or because they are trivial. 
  Run time performance should be the basis of comparison and it may not be bounded
  (only) by the number of compares (see p327 regarding cache). There is nothing in 
  the literature about using tree preorder for sorting. Preorder isn't defined in 
  this text until chapter 4 on p578. I'll revisit this exercise after studying that 
  chapter, if it occurs to me.
