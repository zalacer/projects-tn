/* p330
  2.4.19  Implement the constructor for MaxPQ that takes an array of items 
  as argument, using the bottom-up heap construction method described on 
  page 323 in the text.
  
  Although swim is called a bottom-up (re) heapify method on p315, a question
  on p238 refers to "the tricky bottom-up method described on page 323" so
  I guess the constructor wanted is the one already in 
      http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/24pq/MaxPQ.java 
  and
      http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/24pq/MinPQ.java.html
  These are available locally in pq.MaxPQ and pq.MinPQ in which the array 
  constructors are identical and enhanced to capture the class of Key for use in
  toArray();
