  2.3.11  Suppose that we scan over items with keys equal to the partitioning itemâ€™s
  key instead of stopping the scans when we encounter them. Show that the running time
  of this version of quicksort is quadratic for all arrays with just a constant number
  of distinct keys.
  
  This happens since when compares accept equals quicksort does very poor partitioning
  in which many zero length subarrays are created.  A case example of this is shown
  below along with the doubling test. The latter also showed that quicksort incurs a 
  high cost in terms of stack space especially when compares accept equals. The miminal
  utilization of stack is what I like about bottom-up mergesort, especially with Java
  which has no optimization of tail recursion.
  
  Actually proving that quicksort implemented with compares that accept equals is 
  quadratic for all arrays with distinct keys appears to be long and complicated and 
  requires concepts and methods not provided in this course. An example paper using the 
  required methodology is "Sorting Discrete i.i.d. Inputs: Quicksort Is Optimal" by 
  Sebastian Wild published on 8/16/2016 and available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04906
  and in this project at SortingDiscreteIIDInputs-Quicksort is Optimal-Wild-2016.pdf.
  This paper is relevant because it proves for the first time the Sedgewick-Bentley 
  conjecture on the optimality of median-of-k Quicksort on equal keys, which has been 
  open since 2002.
