  2.3.10  Chebyshevâ€™s inequality says that the probability that a random variable 
  is more than k standard deviations away from the mean is less than 1/(k^2). For 
  N = 1 million, use Chebyshevâ€™s inequality to bound the probability that the number 
  of compares used by quicksort is more than 100 billion (.1*N^2 ).
    
  From proposition K on p293 "Quicksort uses ~2N*ln(N) compares on average to sort 
  an array of length N with distinct keys and from p295 "the standard deviation of the 
  number of compares is about .65*N
  
  From http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2017754&seqNum=7 that's based on 
  Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms, 2nd Edition, a more accurate approximation
  to the standard deviation of the number of compares is:
  sqrt((21 - 2*(PI^2)/(3*N) â‰… 0.6482776*N
  
  Based on this, the probability that the number of compares is >1B is <0.00000044449.
