/**
 * from:
 * https://github.com/MichalGoly/CS21120-DoubleEndedPriorityQueue/blob/master/src/cs21120/depq/Mwg2DEPQ.java#L3
 * removed raw types making class generic and eliminated all warnings including 
 * rewriting the inner Interval class generically.
 * added DoubleEndedPQ(K...k) constructor.
 * fixed array expansion to happen in add() when size/2 == heap.length instead of
 * when size == heap.length since each array element adds 2 to size.
 * 
 * added familiar synonyms for methods:
 *    insert -> add
 *    min    -> inspectLeast
 *    max    -> inspectMost
 *    delMin -> getLeast
 *    delMax -> getMost
 * fixed 
 * 
 * Mwg2DEPQ is an implementation of the double ended priority queue (DEPQ) interface
 * provided as part of the CS21100 (Program Design, Data Structures And Algorithms)
 * assignment at Aberystwyth University.
 *
 * DEPQ has been implemented using an interval heap which makes it very efficient.
 * Interval heap is similar to a traditional heap, however each node, represented by
 * the Interval inner class, contains two Comparable elements. Left element is
 * typically smaller (can be equal to) than the right one. If the total amount of
 * elements in the interval heap is odd, the last Interval will hold a second 'dummy'
 * element to make the implementation simpler. All left elements in the interval heap
 * define a min heap, whereas all right elements define a max heap. Therefore in the
 * root Interval the left element is the smallest one in the heap and the right one
 * is the largest one in the heap. Internally all elements are stored inside a
 * standard array which can be expanded if necessary. Size is being tracked in an
 * instance variable.
 *
 * TIME COMPLEXITY SUMMARY
 *
 * Each significant method has an associated complexity analysis in the JavaDoc,
 * however the summary of the efficiency of all methods is presented below.
 *
 * Method name    | Complexity 
 * ---------------+--------------- 
 * size()         | O(1) 
 * isEmpty()      | O(1) 
 * inspectLeast() | O(1) 
 * inspectMost()  | O(1) 
 * add()          | O(log n) 
 * getLeast()     | O(log n) 
 * getMost()      | O(log n)
 *
 * SOURCES
 *
 * In order to understand the concept of an interval heap and the way to implement
 * it, I extensively used this web site:
 * http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~sahni/dsaaj/enrich/c13/double.htm
 *
 * In order to see how the other developers tackled the problem I read through this
 * web site:
 * http://www.mhhe.com/engcs/compsci/sahni/enrich/c9/interval.pdf
 *
 * SELF EVALUATION
 *
 * I belive I have met all the marking criteria to receive a mark of around 80% in
 * each part of the assessment. My DEPQ is functioning correctly, has a very high
 * efficiency due to the way it has been implemented. Furthermore, the documentation
 * is clear an informative and each significant method has an associated complexity
 * analysis with the summary in the class-wide JavaDoc comment. Finally, I believe
 * that my code is clean an simple to understand, which means that I would hope to
 * receive an overall mark of around 80% for this assignment.

   * Adds an element to the DEPQ.
   *
   * Method firstly checks if the size of the array which is used to store elements
   * is large enough to accommodate the new one. If it is not, the expand method
   * will be called to increase the capacity of the queue. Then, depending on the
   * current size of the queue, the Comparable element will either be placed in the
   * newly created root Interval (if size was 0), or it will be placed in the
   * appropriate position in the root Interval (if size was 1), otherwise its place
   * has to be calculated.
   *
   * We start by checking if the amount of elements in the queue is odd or even.
   *
   * If it is even, the new node needs to be created and its index has to be
   * calculated. Then the parent node of that new index has to be determined. Then,
   * we compare our Comparable element with the smaller element of its parent. If
   * Comparable is smaller than the smaller element of its parent, we know that it
   * should be placed somewhere in the min part of the interval heap. Therefore we
   * call the minHeapInsert method which will bubble the Comparable element into its
   * proper position, while shifting other elements if necessary. If Comparable is
   * larger than the smaller element of its parent, we call the maxHeapInsert method
   * to place the element into its correct position in the max heap part of the
   * interval heap. Finally, we duplicate the last element in the queue in order to
   * make other methods easier to implement.
   *
   * If it is odd, we do not have to create a new node, therefore we simply
   * calculate the last element, its parent, determine whether to put it in the min
   * or max part of the heap and call either minHeapInsert or maxHeapInsert
   * appropriately. We do not have to duplicate anything at the end, as the size
   * after the operation will be even.
   *
   * COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
   *
   * In the best case scenario, the complexity is constant O(1) when the size of the
   * queue before the addition is either 0 or 1. Because we only need to perform a
   * single operation. In the worst case, we have to go through the whole heap from
   * bottom to the top. The height of the heap is equal to log(n), where n is the
   * amount of elements in the heap. Because the complexity of comparing elements
   * throughout the walk is constant, the worst case complexity of the add method is
   * O(log n).
