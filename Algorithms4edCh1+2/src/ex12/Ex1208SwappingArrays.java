//  1.2.8  Suppose that  a[] and  b[] are each integer arrays consisting of millions of inte-
//  gers. What does the follow code do? Is it reasonably efficient?
//  int[] t = a; a = b; b = t;
//  Answer. It swaps them. It could hardly be more efficient because it does so by copying
//  references, so that it is not necessary to copy millions of elements.
