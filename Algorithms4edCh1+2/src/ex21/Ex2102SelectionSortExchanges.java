  2.1.2  What is the maximum number of exchanges involving any particular 
  element during selection sort? What is the average number of exchanges 
  involving an element?
  
  Max exchanges is N for a given element in an array array of N elements, which 
  happens when the first element is greater than all the rest, since then it's 
  exchanged with each and finally with itself. The average number of exchanges is 
  1 since for N elements there are always exactly N exchanges (for the unoptimized 
  version given in the text on p249).
